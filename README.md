## 🔖&nbsp; About

The Login Demo Page is a simple project created only with HTML and CSS. It is a simple login page that was created in order to put into practice all the content studied regarding the *form*, *input* and *label* tags and also applying the *flexbox* and *responsiveness* properties.
I emphasize that this project is just the frontend form frontend, there is no backend yet.
